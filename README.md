# spearbreaker
Zomboid spearbreaker mod
Quickly Swap broken spears for new ones without using the inventory menu.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
1) Automatically swap to a new spear when one breaks
When a spear breaks during fighting, if your character has another one attached to their back, then it will auto equip the new spear. In addition, the character will drop the broken spear on the ground, since weight is an issue when using spears since players tend to carry several.

2) Attach a spear to your characters back from their inventory by pressing the 'R' key
If your character has a spear equipped in both hands, and they have additional spears in their MAIN inventory, pressing the 'R' key will result in the character attaching a new spear to their back


DESCRIPTION
In Zomboid a spear is a very powerful weapon. However, this power is balanced by their fragility. As a result, players tend to carry many spears and try to equip a new one when the former breaks a soon as possible.

A typical loadout for a spearfighter would look like:
- One in equipped in both hands
- One attached to the characters back slot
- As many in the main inventory as weight will allow (fast access)
- As many as you can carry in your backpack (very, very slow access)

SPEAR PROBLEMS
1) Multiple spears are very heavy and often lead to a weight penalty. Therefore, it's best to drop the heavy spears as soon as they break.
2) Swapping spears from your inventory to your back to your hands is a high-volume task that can detract from fighting.
3) These tasks are accomplished through the inventory menu and that can be an overwhelming task that tends to cause players to run from the fight a great distance simply "cycle" their spears from inventory->back->hands.


SPEARBREAKER PLAYSTYLE
In order to combat the above problems a typical spearbreaker fight will consist of
1) Begin combat with a spear in both hands, one on the characters back, and however many according to weight in inventory.
2) Stab zombies in the face until your spear breaks
3a) You character will reach for the spear on their back and equip it in both hands
3b) Your character is interrupted swapping because you issue another action, like pushing a zombie. Press 1 and equip the spear from your hotslot instead.
4) Stab more zombies in the face, when you have sufficient space between you and the zombies, press 'R' and reload a new one to your back
5) Repeat until you are out of inventory

FUTURE GOALS
1) Bare hands - You have to have a spear in your hands to reload. I'll look at tackling the more complicated edge cases in a future version
2) Reloading from a backpack - There is no way to reload from spears in your character's backpack
